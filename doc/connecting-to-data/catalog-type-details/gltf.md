This is useful when the preview will be very slow to load.-----`name`: **string**The name of the catalog item.-----`description`: **string**The description of the catalog item. Markdown and HTML may be used.-----`nameInCatalog`: **string**The name of the item to be displayed in the catalog, if it is different from the one to display in the workbench.-----`favoriteInfoSection`: **object**Yay_Properties_:* `name`: **string**, The name of the section.* `content`: **string**, The content of the section, in Markdown and HTML format. Set this property to null to remove this section entirely.-----`info`: **object[]**Human-readable information about this dataset._Properties_:* `name`: **string**, The name of the section.* `content`: **string**, The content of the section, in Markdown and HTML format. Set this property to null to remove this section entirely.-----`origin`: **object**The origin of the model, expressed as a longitude and latitude in degrees and a height in meters. If this property is specified, the model's axes will have X pointing East, Y pointing North, and Z pointing Up. If not specified, the model is located in the Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed frame._Properties_:* `latitude`: **number**, Latitude in degrees* `longitude`: **number**, Longitude in degrees* `height`: **number**, Height above ellipsoid in metres-----`upAxis`: **string**The model's up-axis. By default models are y-up according to the glTF spec, however geo-referenced models will typically be z-up. Valid values are 'X', 'Y', or 'Z'.-----`forwardAxis`: **string**The model's forward axis. By default, glTF 2.0 models are Z-forward according to the glTF spec, however older glTF (1.0, 0.8) models used X-forward. Valid values are 'X' or 'Z'.-----`scale`: **number**The scale factor to apply to the model-----`shadows`: **string**Indicates whether this tileset casts and receives shadows. Valid values are "NONE", "BOTH", "CAST", and "RECEIVE".
